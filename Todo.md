# Features

# To fix
- [ ] Functions and assignation: parse multiple tokens
- [ ] Invalid Statement: pretty error message with line number and token position
- [ ] Tokenization: token position fix (currently end of the token, should be at the beginning)
- [ ] ReadMe
- [ ] Variable management: fix "int", maybe we should have multiple types?
- [ ] Node: think about refactoring the code, sub-classes? metaprogramming?
- [ ] Docstrings: better comments
- [ ] Tests: test sample mains and compare with actual python output, to make sure we don't have regressions
- [ ] Compile script: add options to the script, handle exceptions
